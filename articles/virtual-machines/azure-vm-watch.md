# VM watch: Enhancing VM health monitoring (preview)

VMWatch, a standardized, lightweight, and open-sourced testing framework designed to enhance the monitoring and management of guest VMs on the Azure platform, including both 1P and 3P instances. VMWatch is engineered to collect vital health signals across multiple dimensions, which will be seamlessly integrated into Azure's quality systems. By leveraging these signals, VMWatch will enable Azure to swiftly detect and prevent regressions induced by platform updates or configuration changes, identify gaps in platform telemetry, and ultimately improve the guest experience for all Azure customers.

VM watch is delivered via the [Application Health VM extension](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/health-extension?tabs=rest-api) to provide ease of deployment and manageability for customers. In addition, VM watch is offered at no extra cost.

## Monitoring specifics for VM watch

- **Ease of adoption**: VM watch is available through the [Application Health VM extension](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/health-extension?tabs=rest-api).
- **Flexible deployment**: You can enable VM watch by using an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template), PowerShell, or the Azure CLI.
- **Compatibility**: VM watch operates seamlessly in both Linux and Windows environments. It's suitable for individual VMs and virtual machine scale sets alike.
- **Resource governance**: VM watch provides efficient monitoring without affecting system performance. Resource caps on the CPU and memory utilization of the VM watch process help protect VMs.
- **Out-of-the-box readiness**: VM watch comes equipped with a suite of default tests that you can configure for your scenarios.

### VM watch Memory Constraints

To maintain consistent performance across different virtual machine (VM) configurations, **VM watch** enforces memory usage limits according to the VM SKU's total available memory. The memory caps are adjusted dynamically based on the VM's memory tier.

| **VM Memory Range** | **VM watch Memory Cap** |
|:---:|:---:|
| Less than 8 GB | 80MB |
| 8 GB to 16 GB | 200MB |
| Greater than 16 GB | 400MB |

| **ActiveConnectionOpenings** | Metric | The number of times that TCP connections made a direct transition to the `SYN_SENT` state from the `CLOSED` state. |
| **PassiveConnectionOpenings** | Metric | The number of times that TCP connections made a direct transition to the `SYN_RCVD` state from the `LISTEN` state. |
| **CurrentConnections** | Metric | The number of connections established. |
| **SegmentsReceived** | Metric | The number of segments received, including segments received in error. |
| **SegmentsSent** | Metric | The number of segments sent, including segments on current connections but excluding segments that contain only retransmitted octets. |


### Disk
